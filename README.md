# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This project contains implementations of different **CPU Scheduling Algorithms** used in Operating Systems. These algorithms are important for managing processes and improving CPU efficiency.

📌 Algorithms Implemented
* First Come First Serve (FCFS)
* Shortest Job First (SJF)
* Round Robin (RR)
* Priority Scheduling
  
⚙️ Features
* Calculates **Waiting Time** and **Turnaround Time**
* Supports different scheduling methods
* Helps in comparing algorithm performance

 🖥️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** C / C++ / Java / Python *(update based on your code)*
* **IDE/Editor:** Any code editor like VS Code, Eclipse, Code::Blocks

 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in your editor.
3. Compile and run the file for the algorithm you want to test.
